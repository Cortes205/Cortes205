- Hi, I’m @Cortes205, my name is Alan!
- I love problem solving and learning new things. I have a high interest in software and web development. 
- My favourite programming language is Java (mostly due to it being what I'm learning/using in school), however I can code well in C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I know some python as well.
- This summer I plan to learn C and C++ before I head off to university. I know a little bit, however, I'm going to learn more concepts and get comfortable with them. I'm also planning to make a website portfolio! It won't have much but might as well start early!
- During university I hope to learn French and Portuguese in my spare time when I'm not at work or doing homework. I've been learning Spanish for a while (I'm better at reading and writing) so learning other Romance languages shouldn't be too hard, I hope... but I always seem to challenge myself, so I know I can get it done!
- I hope you like the projects I have worked on! If you have any questions or suggestions just let me know!
