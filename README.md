# Hi, my name is Alan!

**I create stuff**

<p>I'm a computer science student at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada</p>

<p>I love problem solving and learning new things<br>
I have a high interest in software and web development, cloud computing, AI, and much more</p>

<p>My favourite programming language is Java (it being the first language I learned). However,<br>
I can code very well in C/C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and since the learning never stops, this list will keep growing!</p>

<p>I speak English, Spanish, and am currently learning Portuguese!<br>
I hope to learn French this summer once this semester finishes</p>

<p>Outside of my work, I love listening to music, going to the gym, cooking, and watching movies</p>
