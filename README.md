- Hi, I’m @Cortes205, my name is Alan!
- I love problem solving and learning new things. I have a high interest in software and web development. 
- My favourite programming language is Java (mostly due to it being what I learned in highschool), however I can code well in C, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I know some python as well.
- I can speak English and Spanish, and I want to start learning French and Portuguese.
- I hope you like the projects I have worked on! If you have any questions or suggestions just let me know!
